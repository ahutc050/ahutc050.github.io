                    <strong>Teeth Exams, Cleaning and Polishing</strong><br>
                    Dog and cat dental cleanings are very similar to human dental cleanings, except that we are required to use anesthesia to properly and safely examine and clean the teeth. After the cleaning, our veterinarians perform a thorough oral exam and check for signs of disease like gum loss, root exposure, or pockets around the root.
    
                    Also similar to human dentistry, we do full mouth radiographs (x-rays) of your pet. This allows our veterinarians to be able to evaluate the roots of your pet's teeth as well as any disease or abnormalities that are located below the gum line and not visible on examination alone.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Tooth Extraction</strong><br>
                    We make every effort to save teeth that we feel have a chance to be successfully treated. In many circumstances, however, periodontal disease is so advanced that treatment without extraction is unsuccessful. We only extract teeth that in the doctor's opinion are beyond saving.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Minor Oral Surgery</strong><br>
                    Many teeth require oral surgery to safely remove each individual root. We have extensive training and experience to perform these procedures properly. Pain medications are administered in clinic and provided for in-home aftercare.

                    We will help you make the right dietary changes for your pet so that they can stay on track living their happy and healthy lives. A healthy diet and good nutrition can reduce or even eliminate the following problems:
                    <br><br>
                    <li>pet allergies</li>
                    <li>itching and scratching</li>

                    <li>intestinal disorders</li>
                    <br>
                    Skin and coat supplements are a great way to keep your pet looking and feeling their best. Arthritis and joint supplements can be helpful for many pets as they age.

                    <strong>Why should I have my pet spayed or neutered?</strong><br>
                    There are many benefits that come with spaying your female companion animal. They include helping to control the stray dog and cat population, eliminating the sometimes 'messy' heat cycles that attract male dogs, and preventing diseases in your pet such as pyometra (infection in the uterus) and mammary cancer. Additionally, research has shown that spayed pets live longer than pets that have not been spayed.
                    <br><br>
                    There are also many benefits that come with castrating your male companion animal. These benefits include helping to control the stray dog and cat population, eliminating undesirable and embarrassing behavior, and preventing diseases in your pet such as prostate disease and testicular cancer.

                    <strong>Why are vaccinations important?</strong><br>
                    Vaccinations are vital to the health and protection of your pet, and serve as a preventive measure in combating viral diseases like Parvovirus, Parainfluenza virus, Distemper, Lyme, Panleukopenia, Feline Leukemia Virus, and Rabies.
    
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>When should my pet get vaccinated?</strong><br>
                    Vaccinations are particularly important for puppies, kittens, and other young animals that have immature immune systems. Veterinary vaccinations generally begin at 6-8 weeks of age and then boostered throughout your pet’s life depending on the vaccine. Our doctors will determine the appropriate vaccination plan for your pet.

                    <strong>Laser Therapy</strong><br>
                    Laser therapy uses a beam of light to deeply penetrate tissue, absorbing into the cell without damaging it and inducing a response called “photo-bio-modulation,” which helps reduce pain. While treating the affected area, the laser light generates a feeling of gentle and soothing warmth.
      
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Acupuncture Therapy</strong><br>
                    At a glance, acupuncture therapy may seem like an unnecessary way to spoil your pets. However, according to the American Animal Hospital Association, there are proven positive effects that can enhance your pet’s quality of life. Acupuncture is a pain-free form of treatment that involves inserting thin needles into specific points of the body to stimulate healing. This treatment should be considered if your pet is suffering from conditions causing pain and inflammation.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Chiropractic Therapy</strong><br>
                    Veterinary chiropractic care (a.k.a. veterinary orthopedic manipulation) is the holistic practice of manipulating the spine in order to treat a disease. It is most often performed on horses, dogs, and cats, however, it can theoretically be performed on any vertebrate species.
